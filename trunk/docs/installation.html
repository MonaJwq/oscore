<title>OSCore Installation</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Just as the requirements alluded to, there are two different ways to install
  OSCore: deployable <b>oscore.jar</b> as an EJB module to an application server,
  or including <b>oscore.jar</b> as a library in a web module.</p>
<h3>Non-EJB Installation</h3>
<p>Place <b>oscore.jar</b> in your application's classpath, such as WEB-INF/lib.</p>
<h3>EJB Installation</h3>
<p>We cannot possible provide installation details for every applications server
  that OSCore supports natively or otherwise. We can, however, provide general
  information that may be useful for deploying either the EJB module or the example
  EAR module included.</p>
<p>When deployable oscore in one of your existing J2EE applications, you'll want
  to add the following to your application.xml file:</p>
<pre>	&lt;module&gt;
	 &lt;ejb&gt;oscore.jar&lt;/ejb&gt;
	&lt;/module&gt;
</pre>
<p>If your applications server isn't supported natively by OSCore, you'll need
  to create vendor-specific deployment descriptors to handle non-standard tags
  such as JNDI names, CMP mappings, and datasource names. For your convenience,
  the standard JNDI names and recommended CMP mappings are listed below:</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>Bean</td>
    <td>JNDI Name</td>
    <td>CMP Mappings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sequence</td>
    <td>os.Sequence</td>
    <td>
      <p><b>Table name</b>: OS_SEQUENCE<br>
        <b>name</b> -&gt; NAME<br>
        <b>actualCount</b> -&gt; VALUE</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SequenceGenerator</td>
    <td>os.SequenceGenerator</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In general, you can create the neccessary table with the following SQL entry:</p>
<pre>	CREATE TABLE OS_SEQUENCE (NAME VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY, VALUE NUMERIC);</pre>
<p>If you do create any vendor-specific deployment descriptors for any app servers
  not currently natively supports by OSCore, please email us the files at <a href="mailto:opensymphony-developers@lists.sourceforge.net">opensymphony-developers@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
